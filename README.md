Yes, it'll be kind of fork of [https://github.com/nodeschool](https://github.com/nodeschool) at first.
But NodeJS community is doing a great job, we have something to learn from them.
The basic idea - have the same type of events that they do, build [workshops](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) as they did but in ruby and gems.

Please fork it and send us improvements! Read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more details on how to send a great PR.
